### <u>Part 3</u>

1. **What is difference between Gradle and Maven? Why is Gradle used extensively in Android project developments?**

   **A:** The major difference between Gradle and Maven are: flexibility, performance, user experience and dependency management. (<https://gradle.org/maven-vs-gradle/>)

   - Flexibility: Gradle is more modeled in a way that is extensible in the most fundamental ways. Maven provides a very rigid model while Gradle's model allows to be used for native development with C/C++ and can be expanded to cover any ecosystem.

   - Performance: Gradle's build performance is faster than Maven for most scenario.

   - User Experience: Maven's longer tenure means it has better support through IDEs for many users, however, Gradle is also improving quickly, such as developed Kotlin-based DSL and Gradle has more powerful command-line operations, also, Gradle provides an interactive web-based UI for checking logs, debugging and optimizing builds.

   - Dependency Management: Both are able to cache dependencies locally and download them in parallel. Maven allows users to override a dependency, but only by verion. Gradle allows users to declare API and implementaion dependencies to prevent unwanted libraries from leaking into the class paths of consumers.

     **Why Gradle?**(<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16754643/what-is-gradle-in-android-studio>)

     Some features made us to choose Gradle:

   - Domain Specific Language (DSL) to describe and manipulate the build logic
   - Build files are Groovy based and allow mixing of declarative elements through the DSL and using code to manipulate the DSL elements to provide custom logic.
   - Built-in dependency management through Maven and/or Ivy.
   - Very flexible. Allows using best practices but doesn’t force its own way of doing things.
   - Plugins can expose their own DSL and their own API for build files to use.
   - Good Tooling API allowing IDE integration

   

2. **What is project structure in Android Studio? List down the folder structure created for your application.**

   **A:** The most important project files are the following (<https://developer.android.com/studio/projects#ProjectStructure>)
> - build/     Contains build outputs.
> - libs/      Contains private libraries.
> - src/       Contains all code and resource files for the module in the following subdirectories:
>     + androidTest/    Contains code for instrumentation tests that run on an Android device. For more information, see the    Android Test documentation.
>     + main/           Contains the "main" sourceset files: the Android code and resources shared by all build variants (files for other build variants reside in sibling directories, such as src/debug/ for the debug build type).
>         * AndroidManifest.xml: Describes the nature of the application and each of its components. For more information, see the AndroidManifest.xml documentation.
>         * java/   Contains Java code sources.
>         * jni/    Contains native code using the Java Native Interface (JNI). For more information, see the Android NDK documentation.
>         * gen/  Contains the Java files generated by Android Studio, such as your R.java file and interfaces created from AIDL files.  
>         * res/  Contains application resources, such as drawable files, layout files, and UI string. See Application Resources for more information.
>         * assets/   Contains file that should be compiled into an .apk file as-is. You can navigate this directory in the same way as a typical file system using URIs and read files as a stream of bytes using the AssetManager . For example, this is a good location for textures and game data.
>     + test/   Contains code for local tests that run on your host JVM.
>     + build.gradle (module) This defines the module-specific build configurations.
> - build.gradle (project)
This defines your build configuration that apply to all modules. This file is integral to the project, so you should maintain them in revision control with all other source code.
For information about other build files, see Configure Your Build.

**3. What is “adb” and where is it located? What is the importance of “adb”?**

   **A:** "adb" means Android Debug Bridge, it is a versatile command-line tool that let us communicate with a device. The adb command facilitates a variety of device actions, such as installing and debugging apps, and it provides access to a Unix shell that you can use to run a variety of commands on a device. It is very powerful and allows us to directly operate from the system level through shell commands on handheld devices. (<https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb>)

**4. Use “Android Monitor” for your application and attach screenshots of your application graphs from Android Monitor, in report.**
